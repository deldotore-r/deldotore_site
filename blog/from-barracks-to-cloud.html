        <div class="article-content">
            <p>
                Technology and a military career may seem like distant worlds at first glance. On one side, lines of code, virtual servers, and automation; on the other, hierarchy, rigorous procedures, and field operations. However, after three decades of military service, upon migrating to the <strong>DevOps and Cloud</strong> ecosystem, I realized that the foundations of both are identical: <strong>method, predictability, and resilience.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                In this article, I share how the principles that guided my career in the Military Police have become my greatest allies in managing critical infrastructures.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and Infrastructure as Code</h3>
            <p>
                In a military environment, improvisation is the shortest path to failure. Everything is guided by Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Standard Administrative Procedures (SAPs) to ensure the mission is accomplished, regardless of who is in command.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the DevOps world, I found the perfect equivalent in <strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</strong>. When we use tools like <strong>Terraform</strong>, we are essentially writing the "Operations Manual" for our infrastructure. The discipline of not making manual changes ("ClickOps") and ensuring that every resource is versioned and documented is what separates an unstable environment from an operation of excellence.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Crisis Management and High Availability Culture</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most valuable lessons I brought from the Military Police is the ability to remain calm under pressure and act based on contingency plans. In the Cloud, this translates into designing architectures with failure in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mindset is the same: <em>what will we do if Plan A fails?</em> A system's resilience is not a matter of chance, but of meticulous planning that anticipates the worst-case scenario to ensure the service never stops.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Security: The Virtual Perimeter</h3>
            <p>
                In the barracks, physical security and access control are fundamental. In the Cloud, the perimeter is logical. My transition to <strong>IAM (Identity and Access Management)</strong> and network security was natural, as I understand that security is not an additional feature, but the foundation of any project. Applying the "least privilege" principle is, for me, a matter of doctrine.
            </p>

            <h3>4. The Pursuit of Continuous Improvement</h3>
            <p>
                Military service taught me that study must be a daily routine. Technology evolves at a frantic pace: from physical servers to Serverless, from Docker to Kubernetes. Maintaining a routine of labs, certifications, and technical reading is not just a market necessity; it is a habit of discipline that I carry with me.
            </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    The career transition has shown me that tools change, but values remain. Today, looking at a CI/CD pipeline or a complex cluster, I see more than just technology; I see an operation that demands order, vigilance, and impeccable execution.
                </p>
                <p><strong>The mission is now in the Cloud, but the commitment to excellence remains the same.</strong></p>
